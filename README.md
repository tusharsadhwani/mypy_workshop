# mypy_workshop

Contains all material used for my 3-hour workshop teaching [mypy][1], a static
type checker for Python, to beginners.

It has:

- A starter file to tinker with: `code.py` and its typed version `typed_code.py`
- A tic-tac-toe game made from scratch using type hints in mind: `typed_tic.py`
- A `webapp.py` written in flask, and type hinted `typed_webapp.py`
